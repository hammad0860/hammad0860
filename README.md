Projects
Hotel Asset Plus Application September 2023 – December 2023
Model-Based-Programming (ECSE 223), McGill University, Montreal, QC

• Collaborated in a group with six other students to develop an application which managed the assets of a hotel thereby leading to increased experience in coordinating with a team and in how Git/GitHub is used in coding projects.

• The application was developed in Java using the model-view-controller pattern. Moreover, Gherkin scenarios were implemented and used as acceptance tests and a graphical user interface was designed in JavaFX and integrated with the project. Creating this application resulted in an improved understanding of how to implement a project using the model-view-controller pattern and test-driven development.

• A UML and state diagram were used with Umple to generate code for the application. Consequently, there was a way to better the understanding of how modelling tools can be used to streamline the development process.

CodeJam Hackathon November 2023
123Loadboard’s Challenge, CodeJam Hackathon, Montreal, QC

• Demonstrated the ability to work against a tight deadline within a team setting by delivering a functional application within 48 hours through coordination with three other students.

• The back end of the application was developed in Python and functioned by calculating and using scoring factors to compute a mean score for each instance. Coding the backend allowed for increased experience in applying algorithms and data structures to solve real-life problems.

• Proficiency in problem-solving was improved by proposing statistical techniques, such as taking the reciprocal of a score, to normalize the score of each scoring factor relative to the instances.
