My name is Muhammad and I'm a third-year software engineering student studying at McGill univeristy. Here's a little bit about me,

# Programming Languages: 
Python and Java
# Technical Proficiencies: 
Umple, JavaFX, UML and state diagrams, design patterns, model-view-controller-pattern, Gherkin, test-driven development, and Git.

# Projects:

# Hotel Asset Plus Application:

• Collaborated in a group with six other students to develop an application which managed the assets of a hotel thereby leading to increased experience in coordinating with a team and in how Git/GitHub is used in coding projects.

• The application was developed in Java using the model-view-controller pattern. Moreover, Gherkin scenarios were implemented and used as acceptance tests and a graphical user interface was designed in JavaFX and integrated with the project. Creating this application resulted in an improved understanding of how to implement a project using the model-view-controller pattern and test-driven development.

• A UML and state diagram were used with Umple to generate code for the application. Consequently, there was a way to better the understanding of how modelling tools can be used to streamline the development process.

# CodeJam Hackathon:

• Demonstrated the ability to work against a tight deadline within a team setting by delivering a functional application within 48 hours through coordination with three other students.

• The back end of the application was developed in Python and functioned by calculating and using scoring factors to compute a mean score for each instance. Coding the backend allowed for increased experience in applying algorithms and data structures to solve real-life problems.

• Proficiency in problem-solving was improved by proposing statistical techniques, such as taking the reciprocal of a score, to normalize the score of each scoring factor relative to the instances.


# Assembly Calculator Application 

• Designed and implemented a calculator in assembly, utilizing a simulated ARM processor to execute low-level computations efficiently to achieve high level functionality

• Configured the calculator to access memory directly for reading slider inputs and detecting rising and falling edges of push buttons, demonstrating precise hardware interaction

• Enabled the calculator to perform arithmetic operations and output result to a hex-display in base 10, showcasing proficiency in number systems and data representation at the hardware level

# DNS Client Implementation

• Built a DNS client in Python that handled A, MX, and NS requests, incorporating network protocols, error handling, and response parsing, thereby developing a solid foundation in networking concepts and low-level socket programming.

# CPU Design

• Leveraged Logisim to design core components, including an ALU and Register File, and implemented a basic CPU that executes instructions from ROM, supporting branching and memory access operations.

• Engineered the CPU to parse and execute instructions bit by bit, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of instruction-level processing, control flow, and instruction encoding

• Designed the ALU to perform arithmetic and logic operations, and had branching capabilities integrated to handle conditional instructions, showcasing knowledge of the fundamentals in computer architecture.

# CSV Backed Database 

• Developed a command-line program in C that efficiently manages a persistent database, demonstrating strong skills in system-level programming and dynamic memory management.

• Implemented robust command-line parsing and directed errors to STDOUT, ensuring error visibility, showcasing proficiency in low-level input/output handling and program stability.
